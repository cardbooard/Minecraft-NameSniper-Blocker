# Minecraft-NameSniper/Blocker

This program has the ability to automatically snipe or block names that are being released. I encourage you to edit the code and make it better.
## Different Methods

### **Blank method**:
This would consist of an account that does not own a copy of Minecraft.

This method will block a username from anyone else changing their username to it.

After you successfully block a name, you may purchase a copy of Minecraft/redeem a token ith that username.

**Inputs:** Target, and Bearer Key

### **Namechange method**:
This would consist of an account that owns a copy of Minecraft and the ability to change it's name.

This will automatically change the username of the current account to the new username of your choice.

**Inputs:** Target, Username, Password and Bearer Key

## Things to Know
### Time of Availability:
-Uses 24 hours clock

-Use namemc.com to figure when a name will drop.

Example 8:43:12 PM should be 20:43:12

### Username
Username of the account you are sniping it on.
### Password
Password of the account you are sniping it on.
### Target:
The username you wish to snipe/block
### How to get Bearer Key:
Download the Google extension "EditThisCookie"

Login into the account that you wish to snipe / block the name on

Click the EditThisCookie Icon in the top right of google

Look for "bearer_token" and copy and paste it into Bearer Key

Bearer Keys will expire in roughly 2 hours, so sent up the bot within 2 hours of the release of the name
### What is Wait Time?
The program runs a second before the actual release time and this is the amount of seconds it should wait before running.
